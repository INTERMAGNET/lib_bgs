<h1>Intermagnet CD Data Viewer Help</H1>
<h1>Data Sources</h1>
The data viewer needs to be told where to find data. You use the 'Select Data
Sources' dialog for this. To access this dialog click on 'Select Data Sources'
in the 'Database' menu of the main window.
<p>

<p>
The top part of the window shows the list of databases that the software is
using (see the <a href="Databases.html">databases</a> page for a description of
a database).
<p>
To add a new database to the list of data sources click 'Add'. The directory
selector is displayed. Select a directory that contains INTERMAGNET archive year directories
(for example the root directory of an INTERMAGNET CD-ROM or DVD, or a directory on a
hard disk that you have copied the contents of a CD-ROM or DVD to).
<p>
To remove a data source from the list, highlight the item you want to remove and
press the 'Remove' button.
<p>
When a database is added to the list of data sources the program may find
problems during its search through the files in the database. The 'View error
list at severity' set of radio buttons allows you to choose how much information
the program displays about the problems tat it found.
<p>
As well as manually adding databases to the list you can tell the program to
search for them. You do this using the 'Scan' button. Before pressing 'Scan' you
can enter a start point for the scan in the text box - you can enter the name of
any directory on your computer. If you leave the text box blank then the program
will search all the disk space on your computer (including any network drives) -
this can take a very long time.
<p>
The data sources that you have selected are stored when you exit from the
program and automatically re-loaded the next time you start the program.

<h2>Reloading Data</h2>
If a database changes (because, for example, you are working on the files in the
database), you must tell the program to reload the data. If you do not do this,
the program will have an out-of-date list of the database. To reload the data in
all databases use the 'Reload Data' item from the 'Database Menu' (or right
click on the first item in the Explorer window).
