<h1>Intermagnet CD Data Viewer Help</H1>
<h1>Windows</h1>
<p>
The Intermagnet CD Data Viewer software has three main windows.
<a name="WorldMap">
<p>
<h2>World Map Window</h2>
<img src="WorldMapWindow.jpg">
<p>
The window that you see when the program starts shows a view of the World. The
observatories that the program has found in its 
<a href=Database.html>database(s)</a> are shown as red
dots on the world map. If you move your mouse over an observatory its name will
be displayed. If you click on an observatory using the left mouse button then a 
popup-menu will appear with a list of data that you can view. If you use the
right mouse button you will get the same menu, but in a permanent window that
will not close when you select an item from the menu.
<p>
The World Map window also holds the programs menu bar.
<p>
The World Map window is always present while the software is running. If you
close this window, the program will exit.

<a name="Explorer">
<p>
<h2>Explorer Window</h2>
<img src="ExplorerWindow.jpg">
<p>
The Explorer window gives you an alternative view of data on a CD. The
view is similar to the INTERMAGNET archive format directory structure.
To view an object in the Explorer window, double click the object. For example,
to plot data from an observatory using the Explorer window, expand the tree
until the observatory is listed, expand the observatory, select and expand the
data file that you want to view then double click the 'Data Plot' icon.
<p>
The Explorer window also shows you which databases the program is using. For
more information about databases see the <a href="Databases.html">Databases</a>
page.

<a name="Export">
<p>
<h2>Export Window</h2>
<img src="ExportWindow.jpg">
<p>
The Export window allows you to create data files in IAGA 2002 and other data
formats from the INTERMAGNET archive data (the formats are described
<a href="DataFormats.html">here</a>).
The window has been designed so that you can convert as much
data as you want with the minimum of work. The window displays a list of
observatories - you can select more than one observatory by using the SHIFT
key along with the mouse (to select a block of observatories) or the CTRL
key (to add/remove individual observatories from the selection). You can
also select the start date  and duration for the data that you want - if
the file format that you select extends outside the start date or duration
(for example WDC minute data files start at the beginning of a month and
extend for a month) the start date and duration will be automatically adjusted
so that you get more data than you requested (you will never get less
data).
<p>
The 'File length' option controls how much data will be put into a
data file. If (for example) you select a duration of 1 year and a
file length of '1 file/month', then the data will be put into 12
files, each of one month duration. Each time you select a new
data type or format the file length will be set to the default
length for that type/format.
<p>
The 'Group into zip' option allows you to put your data files 
into a zip file. The options work as follows:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Do not use zip file
        <td>This is the default setting. A zip file will not be used. All
        data will be output directly to disk without any compression.
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1 zip/day
        <td>A new zip file will be started for each day and each observatory.
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1 zip/month
        <td>A new zip file will be started for each month and each observatory.
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1 zip/year
        <td>A new zip file will be started for each year and each observatory.
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1 zip/observatory
        <td>A new zip file will be started for each observatory. There
        will be the same number of zip files as observatories selected.
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>All data in 1 zip file
        <td>All the data for the export will go into a single zip file.
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
The 'GIN code' option is only used when you are exporting data in the INTERMAGNET
minute mean format (but you must use it when you write data in this format). It
allows you to set the Geomagnetic Information Node field in the data file. Valid codes are:
    <ul>
        <li>EDI - Edinburgh GIN (British Geological Survey, United Kingdom)
        <li>GOL - Golden GIN (United States Geological Survey, United States of America)
        <li>HIR - Hiraiso GIN (National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Japan)
        <li>KYO - Kyoto GIN (Kyoto University, Japan)
        <li>OTT - Ottawa GIN (Geological Survey of Canada, Canada)
        <li>PAR - Paris GIN (Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, France)
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
The 'show warnings' and 'show errors' check boxes allow you to turn off error
reporting. Errors will be reported if data cannot be found (for example
if it is missing from a CD-ROM or DVD) or data cannot be written. 
If you are planning a large export 
(for example an entire CD-ROM) the software may take some time (for example
an hour or two) to complete the process. You may wish to turn off error
reporting during this process so that you do not need to supervise it. However
you should check carefully afterwards to make sure the data that you want has
all been exported.
<p>
There are many different ways to display the Export Window. You can display it
from the menu bar (under the 'View' menu), by clicking on an observatory in the
World Map and selecting 'Export Data' from the pop-up menu or by expanding a
data file in the Explorer window and clicking on the 'Export Data' icon.
