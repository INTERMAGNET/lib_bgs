<h1>Intermagnet CD Data Viewer Help</H1>
<h1>Data Viewing Options</h1>
It is not always clear what has been recorded in the 4th (total field)
element of the archive format data files. Three different things could
be stored here:
<ul>
    <li>A total field value computed from the main observatory vector data.
    <li>A total field value recorded using an independant instrument (often
        a proton magnetometer).
    <li>The difference between these two values.
</ul>
The data viewer uses a number of rules to determine how total field data
read from archive files is interpreted.

<h2>The SCF database</h2>
The primary means for determining the type of total field data is the
SCF database. This database is an Excel comma separated values (CSV)
file, the same format used for <a href="CSVTables.html"> the lists
of countries and observatories</a>. The database holds an entry for
each individual year of data from each observatory. The entry may
take one of four values:
<ul>
    <li>An 'S' in a year field indicates that F data was provided from
        an independant instrument.
    <li>'V' means F data was calculated from the main observatory instrument.
    <li>'D' means the value is a vector-scalar difference.
    <li>Blank means no data.
</ul>

<p>
The software uses the most recent version of the SCF files that it
finds in the configuration directory ($HOME/.imag/). On Windows $HOME translates
to your 'documents and settings' directory, so look for the files
in somewhere like 
c:\documents and settings\<i>your-username</i>\.imag\ - on UNIX $HOME
is your login directory.

<p>
Each time the software starts it checks for new versions of the
file in the software distribution
itself (i.e. inside the JAVA jar file). Any versions
of the file found in the software distribution that are more
recent than those in the configuration directory
will be copied to the configuration directory and used immediately.

<h2>Other rules</h2>
The SCF database does not cover all eventualities. For example, you
may turn off use of the SCR database using the data viewing options dialog,
or you may want to use data that is outside the range of the SCF database
(ie data before or after the years listed in the database, or from non-INTERMAGNET
observatories). To handle these situations a number of other rules are available.
Whenever the software finds data that the SCF database cannot be applied to
(for whatever reason) it will use these other rules:

<p>
<table border>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Rule</b></td>
        <td><b>Description</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>All F data is vector data</td>
        <td>Any total field data outside the scope of the SCF database
            will be ignored (as it is assumed to be a redundant calculation
            from the XYZ or HDZ elements stored in the archive data format).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>All F data is scalar data</td>
        <td>Any total field data outside the scope of the SCF database
            will be used (as it is assumed to originate from an independant
            scalar instrument).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>All F data is delta-F</td>
        <td>Any total field data outside the scope of the SCF database
            is assumed to represent a difference value in the sense
            F(vector) - F(scalar).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Use the following rules:</td>
        <td>This rule assumes that any total field data outside the scope of
            the SCF data:
            <ul>
                <li>Is vector if it was recorded before a certain year
                <li>Is scalar if it was recorded between this year and a 
                    later year
                <li>Is difference data if it was recorded after the later year
            </ul>
            The two year boundaries used in this rule can be set by the user in
            the data viewing options dialog.
    </tr>
