                   The values are in degrees for D and I, and in 
                   hundreds of nanoTeslas for the intensity elements. 
21-116    24I4     24 4-digit hourly mean values for the day. 
                   The values are in tenth-minutes for D and I, and in
                   nanoTeslas for the intensity elements.
                   The first hourly mean value represents the mean value 
                   between 00:00 UT and 01:00 UT, ..., the 24th value 
                   represents the mean between 23:00 UT and 24:00 UT.
                   A missing value is identified by 9999.

                   If any of the hourly mean values for the day are missing 
                   9999 will appear as the daily mean.

<ul>
 <li>The tabular bases, hourly mean values and daily means are right adjusted and 
     signed if negative. 
 <li>Negative values are identified with a minus sign either adjacent to the first 
     significant digit or in the high-order position  of the field. 
     NOTE: A blank digit will not appear between a (-) sign and the first 
     significant digit. For example, a value may appear as -050 or b-50 but not 
     as -b50 (b=blank).
 <li>The 25 values in positions 21-120 will have the range -999 to 9998, with 9999 
     reserved for missing values. 
 <li>The records are sorted according to observatory code, year, month, element,
     day (positions 1-10).
 <li>For the intensity elements hourly value (nanoTeslas) = tab.base*100 + tab.value
 <li>For the angles D and I hourly value (Degrees) = tab.base + tab.value/600
