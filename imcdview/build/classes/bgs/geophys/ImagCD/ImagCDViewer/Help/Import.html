<h1>Intermagnet CD Data Viewer Help</H1>
<h1>Import Wizard</h1>
<p>
You can import data into the data viewer by using the import wizard.
<p>
To access the import wizard, select 'Database' from the menu bar, 
and select 'Import data'. This will bring up the import wizard, which will
guide you through the import process.
<p>
This wizard allows you to load data into the INTERMAGNET archive format 
and directory structure. Data can already be in the INTERMAGNET archive 
format (to allow exisiting files to be updated), or it can be in the 
INTERMAGNET minute-mean or IAGA 2002 format. In either case, as much 
information as possible will be copied into the INTERMAGNET archive 
files. The INTERMAGNET 'DKA' format for K indices is also supported 
to allow K index data to be loaded. Options allow hourly and daily means 
to be calculated. Alternatively this data may be read from IAGA 2002 
format files if they are present.
