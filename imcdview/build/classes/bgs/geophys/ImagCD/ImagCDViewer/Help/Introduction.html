<h1>Intermagnet CD Data Viewer Help</H1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
INTERMAGNET produces DVDs (and previously produced CD-ROMs) that contain definitive data (final, processed values) 
from a global network of magnetic observatories. The data consist of 
one-minute, hourly, and daily mean values for the vector components (X,Y, Z or D,H, Z), 
and have a resolution of tenth-nanoteslas or tenth-minutes of arc (Declination). 
Total Intensity (F) data and K-index values are also included for many stations. 
<p>
The CD-ROM or DVD itself conforms to the ISO 9660 standards, and can be used on any 
reader that operates on this standard. Further technical details on the CD/DVD can
be found in the Intermagnet technical manual. If your computer is connected to
the INTERNET and your web browser is able to read PDF documents, you can access 
the technical manual from the Help menu of this program.
<p>
The Intermagnet CD Data Viewer software is written
in Java and will run on any computer that has a Java Vritual Machine (JVM) installed.
The software was developed using version 1.5 of the Java Run-Time
Environment (JRE) from Sun Microsystems (1.5 is also the minimum version of the
JRE that the software will work under).
<p>
The access software is a menu-driven program that allows the user to display data in 
both graphics (plots) and text modes. Data can also be saved in a number of
formats, including the IAGA 2002 format.
If your computer is connected to the INTERNET you can access a description of the IAGA 2002
format from the Help menu of this program. Output can also be sent to any printer 
that has been successfully connected to the computer.
