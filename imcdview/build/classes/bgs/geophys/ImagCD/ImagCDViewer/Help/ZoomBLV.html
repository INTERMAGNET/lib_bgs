<h1>Zooming / Scaling/ Scrolling in Baseline Windows</h1>
Scale is the range of a geomagnetic element that will be
displayed in a trace window (the trace is always automatically
positioned so that the mid-value of the data is at the mid-point
of the trace window). Zoom is the magnfication factor applied
to a trace window. Scroll allows you to move the trace up and down
retaining the scale.
<p>There are several different ways in which the windows that plot data
can be scaled and zoomed.
<p>
<h2>Setting the scale</h2>
<p>Choose the scale you require from the scaling combo box.
The 'auto scale' option will automatically fit the entire plot 
in the window. All the components will be drawn to the same scale.
If the scale chosen is not the default scale (first in the combo
box), then the axis will be labelled in red.
<p>
<h2>Zooming a plot</h2>
<p>If you right click your mouse on any of the trace windows, a
menu will appear giving you the option to zoom in (double the magnification)
or zoom out (halve the magnification).
<p>If you drag a rectangle using the left mouse button on any of
the trace windows, the plot will zoom to the rectangle you have created.
If you drag a 'reverse' rectangle (where you release the mouse button to
the left of the point where you pressed it), the magnification will be
reset.
<p>Selecting a new scale also clears all magnification.
<p>
<h2>Scrolling a plot</h2>
<p>The 'Scroll Up' and 'Scroll Down' buttons will move the trace up
and down the screen respectively, which enables the whole trace to be seen
at the desired scale. The plot can be re-centred using 'Reset Scroll'.
