Dear Jane,

Recently I have corrected my software for conversion IMFV1.22 to IAFV2.0 (I 
have found bugs in my program).
So please find attached recently created BEL, HRN 2009.
Unfortunately BEL 2009 binary displayed by means of IMCDVIEW is uncorrect.
I think there are possible format mistakes in our data as well as bugs in 
IMCDVIEW.

My remarks after recent tests are the following:
1)
The difference dF is probably always calculated by IMCDVIEW as Fs-Fv. 
According to IAF format dF should be calculated as Fv-Fs.
This note concerns both IAF 2.0 and v1.0, v1.1
2)
When  4th element (dF) is minus (for IAFV2.0) in place of Fs is displayed 
positive dF and in place of dF is displayed -Fs. It is bad.
When 4th element is positive Fs is displayed correctly, however dF is 
displayed with bad sign (e.g. -0.2nT instead of +0.2nT).

Also please find attached BFO binary, these data I received last week, 
according me dF in BFO is completely not in accordance with IAFV2.0

Furthermore please find attached just created hrn2009.blv (format IBFV2.00).

With kind regards
Jan
