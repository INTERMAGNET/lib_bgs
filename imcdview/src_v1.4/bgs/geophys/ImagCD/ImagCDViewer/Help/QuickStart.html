<p>
Make sure you have the data and program correctly configured by
reading <a href="NewUser.html">New User</a>.
<p>
When the program starts, you will see the world map with red dots
displaying the available observatories, if you right or left click
on an observatory you will get a menu offering you all the data
available for the observatory.
<p>
    
Once you have selected which data
you are interested in the software will normally give you a plot
of the data if this is appropriate, and you will then have the chance
to adjust the plot, and to view the data in numerical form, and to
print or save it.
