<h1>Intermagnet CD Data Viewer Help</H1>
<h1>Data Catalogue</h1>
By clicking on 'View / Data Catalogue' (in the main window) you can
display a catalogue which shows all the data that the programme has found.
The catalogue is displayed as a table, with years as columns, observatories as
rows. For each observatory-year, twelve codes are displayed, one for
each month of the year. If the data is present for a month, the code displayed is
a small green block. Missing data is displayed as a small red block.
If you move the mouse over a cell a detailed description of the data availability
will be shown.
<p>
Clicking on any of the data codes brings up a popup menu that allows you
to access the data for the observatory you have clicked on.
