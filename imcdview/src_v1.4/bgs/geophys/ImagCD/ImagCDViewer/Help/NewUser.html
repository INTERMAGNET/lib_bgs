<h1>Intermagnet CD Data Viewer Help</H1>
<h1>New User</h1>
<p>
The information on this page is for people who have not used the Intermagnet Data
Viewer software before. Most of the software is intuitive and easy to
use but you will need to know how to configure the software to find your data
before you can use any of the functions. To read data from a CD-ROM or DVD take the
following steps:
<ol>
<li>Insert the CD-ROM or DVD in your computer's reader.
<li>Display the 'Select Data Sources' dialog by clicking 
<a href="internal_exec:raise_data_source_dialog&from_main_window">here</a> (the normal way to
find this dialog is from the 'Database' menu on the program's main window).
<li>Press the 'Add' button on the 'Select Data Sources' dialog. A directory
selection dialog is displayed.
<li>If you are using Microsoft Windows: There is a drop down list at the top of 
the directory selection dialog - choose the drive letter that corresponds to
your CD-ROM or DVD drive (e.g. "D:\").
<li>If you are using UNIX: Use the directory selection dialog to navigate to the
directory where your CD-ROM or DVD drive is mounted.
<li>On the directory selection dialog press 'Select directory'.
<li>On the 'Select Data Sources' dialog press 'OK'.
<li>You should see observatories plotted as red dots over the world map in the
main window.
</ol>
