<h1>Zooming / Scaling in Plot Windows</h1>
Scale is the range of a geomagnetic element that will be
displayed in a trace window (the trace is always automatically
positioned so that the mid-value of the data is at the mid-point
of the trace window). Zoom is the magnfication factor applied
to a trace window.
<p>There are several different ways in which the windows that plot data
can be scaled and zoomed.

<h2>Setting the scale</h2>
<p>Pressing the "Plot Options" button on any of the plot windows
will bring up the 
<a href="internal_exec:raise_plot_options_dialog&from_main_window">Plot Options dialog</a>. 
Amongst other things, this
dialog gives you individual control over each of the traces
shown in the plot window, including the scale. The Plot Options
dialog also contains a control that allows you to select options for
all traces at the same time.
<p>The plot windows themselves include the same control allowing
you to set the scale for all of the traces at the same time.

<h2>Zooming a plot</h2>
<p>If you right click your mouse on any of the trace windows, a
menu will appear giving you the option to zoom in (double the magnification)
or zoom out (halve the magnification).
<p>If you drag a rectangle using the left mouse button on any of
the trace windows, the plot will zoom to the rectangle you have created.
If you drag a 'reverse' rectangle (where you release the mouse button to
the left of the point where you pressed it), the magnification will be
reset.
<p>Selecting a new scale also clears all magnification.
