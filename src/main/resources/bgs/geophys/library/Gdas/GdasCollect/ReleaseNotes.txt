Version 1.4
===========

Modified code to support 1 pico Tesla output files on a per GDAS system basis.
This allows individual GDAS systems to be configured for picoTesla or nanoTesla
output file formats.


Version 1.3
===========

Modified code to support 1 pico Tesla output files as an option to configuration.
Previous output format is still supported. Changed behaviour of alarms so that 
GDAS systems that have no 'in use' address set do not produce an alarm state.
Changed some default parameters to more optimised values. Small bug-fix that
prevents XML null characters being written into XML status file as part of the most
recent exception information (this was causing status viewer to crash). 


Version 1.2
===========

Added code to monitor the rate at which data is written to disk and the rate at
which it transferred from the observatory. The file transfer rate is shown in
the base status screen. The network transfer rate is shown in the status screen
for each GDAS address.

Changed the way that the watchdog works. Previously a check was made against the
time of the last successful collection. Now an activity timer is set at many
points during the normal collection operation. The watchdog is checked against
this activity timer. This should allow watchdog elapse times to be made much
smaller, so reducing the time to restart for a failed collection.


Version 1.1
===========

An "in use" and "hostname check" field has been added to the address of each
GDAS system. These fields allow addresses to be taken out of use ("is use") or
conditionally taken out of use ("hostname check")

A bug that prevented scripts from working at all was removed.


Version 1.0
===========
